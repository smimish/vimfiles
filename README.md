# VIM config file

VIM config file which uses key mappings from spacemacs https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs, but at the same time focuses on speed.

The Leader key is set to `SPACE`. Similar functionalities have the same key binding everywhere thanks to a clearly defined set of conventions.

Clone to ~/.vim
Run :PlugInstall on the first run
